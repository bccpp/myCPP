## Git Github

Bam! This is github, an online repository service that provides access to all of the wonderful things that team code collaboration and open data can provide. [Set up an account](https://github.com/join) to get started! Email [me](mailto:apawlows@vols.utk.edu) and I'll add you to the team!

## Install R

`R` is a programming language, originally popular with its native functionality in statistics, but through its myriad of packages available developed by people across the world, has seen explosive growth in data science and of late other coding operations. `Shiny` is a framework that RStudio (_the IDE_ for `R`) developed to transform `R` code to simple web applications. It provides a new way to interact with data that can prove super useful to scientists and engineers without having to be a web developer.

Install R here: [for Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) [for Mac/Linux](https://cran.r-project.org/)

## Install RStudio

This is _the IDE_ for `R`. It simplifies the experience for you to code with `R` providing environments and output panes for you to develop with. For `Shiny`, RStudio is the primary (and by far easiest way) to run a `Shiny` app locally on your machine and to publish to shinyapps.io.

## Install Github

For you to be able to push updates to Github, using Github for Desktop to manage uploading files to Github, rather than using Git through RStudio. This tool provides a great way to interact with markdown documents and other files on the Github Repository.

### Install Git

`Git` is a distributed version control system that just about every large software company uses: Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, LinkedIn, Netflix, etc., which manages distributed work flows. Each team member works on a bit of code, `commit` a change, and `push` to the codebase. From there, `merge` can take place that add the different code pieces together to form one unified change. From there, we can select a `branch` that allows the codebase to keep moving without affecting the most recent stable `release`. It saves a lot of headaches from the usual challenges with multiple people working at the same time. Think of it as the Google Docs for shared coding. Only difference is that you are committing and pushing changes when you are ready, and pulling changes before you start (think of Google Docs as doing this for you automatically)

### Set up Git in RStudio

Excellent guide to [start](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN). Ignore Subversion.
