### Introduction

The University of Tennessee’s Bredesen Center and Department of Nuclear Engineering have undergone a multi-year collaborative effort in evaluating the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Clean Power Plan (CPP) for its accuracy and fair treatment of all energy sources. One previous analysis conducted on the treatment of nuclear energy helped spark significant media coverage and a grassroots campaign throughout the American Nuclear Society responsible for over 500 comments submitted to the EPA [[1](#1)]. Additionally, the Bredesen Center used this research to develop a publication summarizing inconsistencies related to other energy sources within the CPP [[2](#2)]. The final submission of the CPP draft by the EPA addressed the vast majority of this publication’s outlined concerns. The final rule, with addressed comments, was submitted to the Federal Register on August 23, 2015 [[3](#3)] and has been a contentious topic of discussion with interested parties of the United States’ electric utility industry.

To address this interest, the Bredesen Center is leading a collaborative effort in developing the Clean Power Plan State Compliance Evaluation Tool. This tool is focused on aiding policymakers and members of the interested public in understanding state compliance pathways. Although the EPA has provided one recommended pathway in the final CPP, user input variables are capable of displaying all possible pathways to the viewer. This tool is in the process of deployment with a preliminary version scheduled for online distribution. The purpose of this tool is to be a widely accessible, user-friendly, and an accurate representation of state compliance pathways.
Tool Development

The CPP State Compliance Evaluation Tool sources data from the Energy Information Administration’s Application Programming Interface (API) to access yearly published generation and location data for individual power plants in each state [[4](#4)]. This method is similar to the procedure adopted in the EPA’s CPP Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) and is expected to be a direct comparison to the conclusions drawn within the RIA [[5](#5)]. Accessed data is then displayed to the user as a Business As Usual (BAU) compliance pathway for a selected state along with displaying a state map containing all generation sources considered in the CPP. At this stage in development, the user has the capability to manipulate state generation portfolios through variables referenced in the CPP to reduce overall CO2 emissions while meeting consumer electricity demand.

A preliminary version of the CPP State Compliance Evaluation Tool has been developed and demonstrated at the University of Tennessee. Figure 1 shows a simplified outline of this preliminary version. This version maintains simplicity by comparing emissions reductions to CPP goals while verifying that generation meets demand. The possibility of adding more complex economic factors is currently being explored. Specifically, user-defined variables include: increasing a coal fired power plant’s heat rate, adjusting the capacity factor of combined cycle natural gas plants, installation of renewable generation sources, implementation of demand-side energy efficiency, and additional nuclear power generation through power uprates or new installation.

#### Concluding Remarks
The Bredesen Center looks forward to making the CPP State Compliance Evaluation Tool publicly available in early 2016. Upon release, comments on the functionality, accuracy, and utility of this tool are encouraged. This tool is implemented using recently updated EIA data, and therefore the simulation results are real-time and relevant to states and members of the interested public. Additionally, the website is hosted by the University of Tennessee and additional functionality will be incorporated as needed. It is intended that this tool will be updated and relevant for the entirety of the CPP implementation period.
