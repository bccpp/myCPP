Critique of tool: 

1. Fuel tank or green/ red bar that is graphical to say whether what generation is
2. Plan efficiency graphic
  * Important: shows how close are to CO2 reductions
  * If above a certain percentage, eventually change color or notification? 
3. Change text:
  * Previous Generation
  * Current Generation
 * Bold/ box around number
 * Make a visual difference
4. State energy map as background with text floating over
 * Code box for on top of map
5. Indicate Alaska/ hwaii excluded somewhere in the tool
6. Indian reservations addressed
7. Calculations for clean energy sources 
  * Slider bars with associated formulas
  * Similar for coal and natural gas
  * Separate for each:
     * Solar
     * Hydro (?)
     * Wind
     * ** add clean generation not officially included in plan, just allows less use of fossile fuels
     * Biomass drop down: page prompting people to have biomass be included???!!!
8. Sliders for capacity factor 
  * Amount of generation that the plant has produced in the course in the year in comparison of what its capable of producing
  * Ex: solar energy has a max capability of 50%
9. Address concerns from nuclear 
  * Address theoretical max and min
10. Look into vertical slider
11. Slider: current usage is 0****
12. Shiny: find out what the resources are for learning the capabilities
13. Find a way to be able to click on term and have it defined
14. Find out how to link time
  * Allow for the concept of time
  * We need future
     * More important
15. Some plants consistent, some plants not may skew what were putting into the tool???
  * Get structure built, alter it later
  * Placeholders in for time structure
  * Showcase in February
16. Prioritization
  * Go through list and guess time to code
  * Identify complexity of the code
    * Beginner (B)
    * Mid (M)
    * Advanced (A)
17. Doodle poll for video conference
18. Goal mid jan: look cool with basic functionality 
    * Map 
    * Capacity factor
    * Additional slider clean energy
    * Gauges for plan efficiency and energy demand
19. Goal spring: 
    * discuss later
