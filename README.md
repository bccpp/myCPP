# Welcome to the myCPP Tool

This is a repository for the "my Clean Power Plan", or "myCPP", tool. The scope of the tool is to facilitate comprehension of state implications with respect to the EPA's Clean Power Plan.

In light of recent legal proceedings, the scope of the tool has been repurposed from that of targeting state legislators, to educationing the general public on sources of electrical power and corresponding carbon emissions. This new "my Clean Power" (myCP) tool is located at http://github.com/mycpp/my-clean-power 

The repository for the "My Clean Power Plan" tool will remain as is, while updates to the tools will be dedicated to the "my Clean Power" tool and its living repository. More information on the scope and motivation for the original myCPP tool can be found below. 

## About
The University of Tennessee Bredesen Center and the University of Tennessee Nuclear Engineering department have undergone a multi-year collaborative effort in evaluating the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Clean Power Plan (CPP) for its accuracy and fair treatment of all energy sources. The Bredesen Center has used this research to develop a publication summarizing many inconsistencies found within the CPP. The final submission of the CPP draft by the EPA addressed the vast majority of this publication’s outlined concerns.

## Tool Development
To address this interest, the Bredesen Center is leading the collaborative effort through the development of a Clean Power Plan State Compliance Evaluation Tool to aide policymakers and members of the interested public in understanding state compliance pathways. This tool is in the process of deployment with a preliminary version scheduled for online distribution. The purpose of this tool is to be a widely accessible, user-friendly, and accurate representation of state compliance pathways.
